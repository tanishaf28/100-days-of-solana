# Day 60: Adding Failure Tests and Extracting Shared Helpers

## Steps

1. Open `programs/counter/tests/counter.rs`. Keep the passing `initialize_then_increment` test from Day 59 in this file; tomorrow's experiments depend on it, and a suite that only checks failures cannot catch a broken happy path. Today I'm adding two failure tests below it, plus three small helpers (`setup_svm_with_program`, `build_initialize_tx`, `build_increment_tx`) that extract the boilerplate already living inside the Day 59 test. Once the helpers exist, the existing test can be refactored to call them too, but that cleanup is optional; deleting the test is not.

   The file already has a `use` block from Day 59. The only new name the helpers need is `Pubkey`, so I merged it into the existing imports rather than pasting a second block (the compiler rejects duplicate names). The merged block looks like this:
   ```rust
   use anchor_lang::{
       prelude::Pubkey,
       solana_program::system_program,
       AccountDeserialize, InstructionData, ToAccountMetas,
   };
   use litesvm::LiteSVM;
   use solana_instruction::Instruction;
   use solana_keypair::Keypair;
   use solana_signer::Signer;
   use solana_transaction::Transaction;
   ```

2. Add the helpers below the imports. They are mechanical:
   ```rust
   fn setup_svm_with_program() -> (LiteSVM, Pubkey) {
       let mut svm = LiteSVM::new();
       let program_id = counter::ID;
       let so_path = concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/../../target/deploy/counter.so");
       svm.add_program_from_file(program_id, so_path).unwrap();
       (svm, program_id)
   }

   fn build_initialize_tx(
       svm: &LiteSVM,
       program_id: Pubkey,
       authority: &Keypair,
       counter_kp: &Keypair,
   ) -> Transaction {
       let ix = Instruction {
           program_id,
           accounts: counter::accounts::Initialize {
               counter: counter_kp.pubkey(),
               authority: authority.pubkey(),
               system_program: system_program::ID,
           }
           .to_account_metas(None),
           data: counter::instruction::Initialize {}.data(),
       };
       Transaction::new_signed_with_payer(
           &[ix],
           Some(&authority.pubkey()),
           &[authority, counter_kp],
           svm.latest_blockhash(),
       )
   }

   fn build_increment_tx(
       svm: &LiteSVM,
       program_id: Pubkey,
       authority: &Keypair,
       counter: Pubkey,
   ) -> Transaction {
       let ix = Instruction {
           program_id,
           accounts: counter::accounts::Increment {
               counter,
               authority: authority.pubkey(),
           }
           .to_account_metas(None),
           data: counter::instruction::Increment {}.data(),
       };
       Transaction::new_signed_with_payer(
           &[ix],
           Some(&authority.pubkey()),
           &[authority],
           svm.latest_blockhash(),
       )
   }
   ```

3. Add the first failure test below the happy-path test. This test initializes a counter with `authority_a`, then tries to increment it while signing with `authority_b`. I expect the transaction to fail because the `has_one = authority` constraint compares the signer to the stored authority and finds a mismatch.
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn increment_fails_when_wrong_authority_signs() {
       let (mut svm, program_id) = setup_svm_with_program();

       let authority_a = Keypair::new();
       let authority_b = Keypair::new();
       svm.airdrop(&authority_a.pubkey(), 1_000_000_000).unwrap();
       svm.airdrop(&authority_b.pubkey(), 1_000_000_000).unwrap();

       let counter = Keypair::new();

       // authority_a creates the counter. This must succeed.
       let init_tx = build_initialize_tx(
           &svm,
           program_id,
           &authority_a,
           &counter,
       );
       svm.send_transaction(init_tx).expect("initialize should succeed");

       // authority_b tries to increment it. This must fail.
       let bad_tx = build_increment_tx(
           &svm,
           program_id,
           &authority_b,
           counter.pubkey(),
       );

       let result = svm.send_transaction(bad_tx);
       assert!(
           result.is_err(),
           "increment should fail when signed by the wrong authority"
       );
   }
   ```
   Notice that the helpers do all the plumbing. The test itself is now about intent: who is the wrong wallet, what call should be rejected, and what assertion proves it.

4. Add a second failure test below the first. This one tries to initialize the same counter account twice. The first call should succeed. The second call should fail because Anchor's `init` constraint refuses to overwrite an account that already exists at that address.

   One subtlety: without the `svm.expire_blockhash()` call below, the two transactions would be byte-for-byte identical (same instruction, same payer, same blockhash, so the same signature), and LiteSVM, like a real cluster, rejects a duplicate signature as already processed before my program ever runs. The test would still see an error, but it would be the wrong error, and the constraint would go untested. Expiring the blockhash makes the second transaction genuinely new, so the failure comes from the account check and not the duplicate check.
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn initialize_fails_when_counter_already_exists() {
       let (mut svm, program_id) = setup_svm_with_program();

       let authority = Keypair::new();
       svm.airdrop(&authority.pubkey(), 1_000_000_000).unwrap();

       let counter = Keypair::new();

       let first_tx = build_initialize_tx(
           &svm,
           program_id,
           &authority,
           &counter,
       );
       svm.send_transaction(first_tx).expect("first initialize should succeed");

       // Advance the blockhash so the second transaction is not a duplicate
       // of the first.
       svm.expire_blockhash();

       // Same counter keypair, same payer. The account is already on chain.
       let second_tx = build_initialize_tx(
           &svm,
           program_id,
           &authority,
           &counter,
       );

       let result = svm.send_transaction(second_tx);
       assert!(
           result.is_err(),
           "initializing the same counter twice should fail"
       );
   }
   ```

5. Look at what the two failure tests do not assert. They check that the transaction returned an error, but not which error. For a Reinforce day this is fine; I'd tighten the assertion tomorrow when deliberately weakening the constraint. For now, take a peek at the error each test observed: temporarily add `println!("{:?}", result);` just above the `assert!` in each failure test, then run `cargo test -p counter -- --nocapture`. The printed `FailedTransactionMetadata` returned by LiteSVM's `send_transaction` includes the program logs. The mismatch test should mention a `ConstraintHasOne` failure. The double-init test should mention that the account is already in use. These are the receipts that prove the constraint did the work.

6. Optional reinforcement: copy the happy-path increment test and add one extra `send_transaction` call at the end that uses `Keypair::new()` as the signer instead of the real authority. Confirm visually that the same constraint is doing the same job from a different angle. If I do this, I don't commit the duplicate test; the point is to feel the symmetry, not to bloat the suite.

## Run it

```bash
cargo test -p counter
```

I should see three passing tests: `initialize_then_increment` from Day 59, plus the two new ones, `increment_fails_when_wrong_authority_signs` and `initialize_fails_when_counter_already_exists`. If the runner reports fewer than three, the happy-path test got deleted while refactoring; restore it before moving on, because tomorrow's experiments need all three. The new tests count as passing because they successfully observed the program rejecting bad input. If either one prints a red FAILED, the assertion at the bottom did not see the error it expected, which means either the test plumbing is wrong or the program let through something it should have blocked. Read the panic message first, then re-read the constraint on the account struct.
